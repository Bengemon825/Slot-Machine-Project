# Slot-Machine-Project


A simple slot-machine style game I created for a homework assignment.

The goal was to use circularly-linked-lists to simulate a physical reel in a slot machine. The lists contain the numbers and letters of a slot reel and a random number is generated to choose how many times the wheel should be spun.
